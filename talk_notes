+ "uhh"
+ what is the microbiome?
+ make need for microbial models clear (before slide 2)
+ emphasize: we can use microbial models to design medicine
+ add context: fecal microbiota transplantaion or bacteriotherapy
+ models come from ecology. microbiome = fast ecology.
+ work on explanation of steady state reduction. "compression of a complex
model into a simplified and mathematically accessible model"
+ mention the mouse system; these models are fit with experimental mouse data

+ more about microbiome as an organ -> needs medicine -> bacteriotherapy
+ microbes not consious
+ didn't explain what bacteriotherapy is
+ "it" can be computationally expensive
+ "trajectory" is a microbial population over time, ignore going to infinity
+ N-dimensional is "true" and 2-dimensional is "approximate" or "compressed"
+ in 2D we can use mathematics, not simulation
+ motivate steady states as "types of bacterial compositions"
